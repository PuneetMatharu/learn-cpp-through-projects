Currently working on the live transport network monitor project.

### Live transport network monitor project description

The city transport company wants to distribute the number of passengers across their lines to balance the network load. They want to create a program that receives live information about passengers' trips and produces travel suggestions that will help keep the network balanced.

Learn to write asynchronous code in C++ that can handle tens of thousands of events from different sources and dispatch operations in reaction to them.
